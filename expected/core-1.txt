GOOD: a pushes 10
GOOD: b-f push 11-15
GOOD: [ turns left
GOOD: ] turns right
GOOD: instructions between ; are skipped
[UNDEF: does # hit or skip easternmost cell in file]
[UNDEF: does # hit or skip easternmost cell on line]
GOOD: 0k^ doesn't execute ^
GOOD: 1k[ turns left from k
GOOD: 4k # jumps 4 times from k
GOOD: 2k ;;;5 executes 5 thrice
GOOD: 2k# jumps twice from k
GOOD: ak47k$ leaves 3 fours on stack
GOOD: 2k6 leaves 3 sixes on stack
GOOD: putting to and getting (-3 -2) worked, assuming working negative Funge-Space
GOOD: 9 / 2 = 4
GOOD: 9 % 2 = 1
About to test division by zero...
GOOD: 1 / 0 = 0
GOOD: 1 % 0 = 0
GOOD: SGML spaces
GOOD: n clears 15-cell stack: assuming it works
GOOD: r reflects
GOOD: 21w turns right
GOOD: ' pushes 20
GOOD: 'vs^ goes through
GOOD: 'vs places v
GOOD: z doesn't reflect
GOOD: 3j jumps over 3 cells
GOOD: 04-j jumps backward the right number of cells
GOOD: 1j ^ jumps into ^
GOOD: 10x goes east
GOOD: 1-1x goes southwest
GOOD: 32x sets delta to (3, 2)
Assuming we can trust x...
GOOD: wraparound with non-cardinal delta appears to work
