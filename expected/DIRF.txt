Testing fingerprint DIRF... loaded.
UNDEF: either C doesn't work or the 'mycodirf' directory doesn't exist
GOOD: created 'mycodirf' with M
GOOD: entered 'mycodirf' directory with C
GOOD: left 'mycodirf' with a C to '..'
GOOD: can't C into 'mycodirf' after R
GOOD: created 'mycodirf' with M
Removed 'mycodirf' with R.

The first UNDEF is expected because the 'mycodirf' directory didn't exist
during testing.
