Testing fingerprint EVAR... loaded.
UNDEF: "PATH"G worked and pushed [the path environment variable]
GOOD: NV failed
GOOD: N1-V worked and pushed [last environment variable]
GOOD: put 'foo=bar' with P
GOOD: "oof"G got "bar"

The first UNDEF is expected because there is an environment variable by the
name of PATH.
