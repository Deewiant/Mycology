Testing fingerprint PERL... loaded.
[UNDEF: whether S claims that Perl is loaded or not]
UNDEF: 0"2+2" E pushed 52 
Perl might not be installed, so it could be the (stringified) error code for not having found Perl, or then it should be 52, the ASCII value of 4.
UNDEF: 0"2+2" I pushed 4 
Again, it could be an error code or 4.

The two UNDEFs are expected because Perl was installed on the testing machine.
