Testing fingerprint TURT... loaded.
Cannot test TURT's drawing correctness in any way, both due to technical reasons and the fact that the precise results are undefined.
Checked will be only that the instructions don't reflect and pop/push correctly.
The resulting image should contain two dots diagonally adjacent to each other.
