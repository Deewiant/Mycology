Splitting IP, concurrency better work...
GOOD: S seems to work
GOOD: C works
Checking if terminating the IP while time is stopped continues time...
GOOD: apparently it does

Starting to test time travel... in case of failure, q will be used to quit.
Much of the output up to and after now, including this, will be output many times. If any of the output changes or there are other anomalies, the interpreter is confused.
But note that if jumping backwards in time is implemented as rerunning from point zero, output during the rerun shouldn't be repeated.

Destroyed the t instruction that made me, setting Tardis with T and E and jumping back...

GOOD: got back and am still alive.
One IP about to jump back, and another jump further back to wait for the first to arrive...
UNDEF: P gave [whatever]
GOOD: P-val is fine for both jumps...
Did 1st jump.

Doing 2nd jump...

UNDEF: P gave [whatever]
UNDEF: 1st IP didn't arrive on time
Did 1st jump.
UNDEF: P gave [whatever]
GOOD: 1st IP arrived on time

GOOD: returned from multiple IP testing
Note that if the first IP didn't arrive on time both times, that is BAD.
It arriving only the second time is fine.

All done, exiting mycotrds.b98...
