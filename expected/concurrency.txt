1y says this is Concurrent Funge-98

Going to test concurrent execution with 2 IPs.
Assuming that instructions without any particular concurrency-related behaviour, such as ^>v<#, take one tick.
Will continue to produce textual output, so strings must work correctly where concurrency is concerned: "a b" should take 5 ticks, 'a should take 1.

GOOD: basic concurrency seems to work
GOOD: reflected IP copied stack
Parent IP: ID [undef]
Child IP: ID [undef]
GOOD: child IP executed before parent IP
GOOD: single space takes 0 ticks
GOOD: multiple spaces take 0 ticks
GOOD: z takes 1 tick
GOOD: jumping over code with ; takes 0 ticks
GOOD: 5kz takes 3 ticks
GOOD: "a  b" takes 5 ticks

Done testing concurrent execution.
